# Railway Deployment - How I Got It Working

## The Problem

So I tried deploying this to Railway and it completely failed. Turns out my Docker image was a massive **6.9GB** which is way over Railway's **4GB limit**. Spent way too long figuring this out!

## What I Fixed

### 1. **Removed Heavy Stuff I Wasn't Even Using**
I was importing all these libraries that looked useful but never actually used:

```diff
- openai==1.86.0          # Was like 500MB+ 
- tiktoken==0.9.0         # Another 200MB 
- numpy==2.3.0            # 50MB I didn't need
- scikit-learn==1.7.0     # Massive 1GB+ 
- sentence-transformers==4.1.0  # 2GB monster
- chromadb==1.0.12        # 500MB+ for vector stuff I never used
```

### 2. **Made a Tiny Docker Image**
Switched to `python:3.11-alpine` instead of the full Python image. Alpine is like 50MB vs 1GB+. Also used multi-stage builds and cleaned up all the caches.

### 3. **Added .dockerignore**
Was accidentally including a bunch of junk:
- Git history
- Documentation files 
- Test files
- Cache directories
- IDE configs

### 4. **Railway-Specific Setup**
Created `railway.toml` and `Dockerfile.railway` specifically for Railway since they have their own quirks.

## Results

**Before**: 6.9GB ❌ (Total failure)  
**After**: ~144MB ✅ (Works great!)

That's a 97.9% size reduction!

## How to Deploy

### Easy Way - Railway CLI
```bash
# Get Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login 
railway login

# Deploy (it'll find railway.toml automatically)
railway up
```

### GitHub Integration Way
1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Go to Railway dashboard
3. Connect your repo
4. It should auto-detect the config and build

### Test First (Optional)
```bash
# Build locally to check
docker build -f Dockerfile.railway -t test-image .
docker run -p 8000:8000 test-image
```

## Check If It Worked

I made a verification script you can run:
```bash
python verify_deployment.py
```

It should show:
- ✅ Way fewer dependencies than before
- ✅ Heavy stuff removed
- ✅ Image size under 200MB
- ✅ All deployment files present

## What Changed (Functionality-wise)

**Good news - nothing broke!**
- All API endpoints still work perfectly
- Token calculator still solves exam problems
- Question answering works the same
- Image processing works fine
- Health checks work

**What I removed:**
- OpenAI API integration (wasn't using it anyway)
- Vector embeddings (overkill for this project)
- ML models (didn't need them)
- Heavy math libraries (weren't being used)

## If Something Goes Wrong

1. **Check logs**: `railway logs` 
2. **Memory issues**: Railway has limits on memory usage
3. **Build timeout**: Sometimes builds take too long
4. **Health check fails**: Make sure `/health` endpoint works

## My Experience

Honestly, the hardest part was figuring out why the build kept failing. Railway's error messages aren't super clear about the 4GB limit. Once I realized that and started removing unused dependencies, it was smooth sailing.

The image is now super fast to build and deploy. Starts up in like 30 seconds instead of taking forever.

## Live Demo

You can see it working at: https://web-production-c2451.up.railway.app/

The interface looks pretty good and all the functionality works as expected. Token calculator solves exam problems correctly, and the question answering is solid.

## Tips for Others

- Always check your Docker image size before deploying
- Use Alpine Linux base images when possible  
- Don't install dependencies you're not actually using
- Test locally with the same Dockerfile you'll use in production
- .dockerignore is your friend - use it!

Hope this helps if you're trying to deploy something similar!
